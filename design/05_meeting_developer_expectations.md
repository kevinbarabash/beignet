# 05 Meeting Developer Expectations

## LSP (Language Server Protocol) Support

- show types and docstring
- typesafe renaming across multiple files

## Sourcemaps

Good support for sourcemaps will have the following benefits:

- ease of debuggability
- support other tooling (test runners, coverage reporters, etc.)

## Modern JavaScript Features

- optional chaining
- nullish coalescing
- JSX support (already codegen'd, but type-checking is incorrect)
- async/await (already supported)
- iterators
- classes
- generators
- decorators
